This repository features the Matlab source codes employed in [1]. Please note that, among the 13 uploaded m-files, the underneath functions can be executed in Matlab to verify the results reported in [1, Sec. V]. 

1.  ''PD_versus_KD_in_single_RFI_detection_same_FAR_diff_INR()'': This function can be executed in Matlab to verify [1, Fig. 2].  
2.  ''PD_prob_RFI_detection_versus_lambda()'': This function can be executed in Matlab to verify [1, Fig. 3].  
3. ''PD_prob_false_alam_versus_lambda()'': This function can be executed in Matlab to verify [1, Fig. 4].   
4.  ''CROC_simulation_for_PD()'': This function can be executed in Matlab to verify [1, Fig. 5].  

At last, please note that all the uploaded functions shall be, first, downloaded to the same folder (in Matlab) prior to the execution of the afore-listed Matlab functions.
